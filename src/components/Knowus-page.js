        <p>
        <h3>
          Love is what drives us. And there’s no limit to what love can do.
        </h3>
        Going to the ends. Where no one else goes. Because love can make the
        greatest impact in the hardest places to be a child. We’re a global
        relief, development and advocacy organization. We partner with children,
        families and their communities to reach their full potential by tackling
        the causes of poverty and injustice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empowering people to rise out of poverty. We bring real and lasting
          change to the lives of the world’s most vulnerable children. For good.

        <h2> FAQ </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span> Is child sponsorship an effective way to help?</span>
            Yes. When you sponsor a child, you help bring long-term changes to
            that child’s community, creating a happier and healthier environment
            in which to grow up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Is the money I give to World Vision handled responsibly?</span>
            Yes. We account for every dollar. Of the funds given to World Vision
            in 2016, 80.5% went directly to programs that help children and
            families, 13.5% went to fundraising, and 6% was allocated to
            administration. Audits are conducted regularly by external firms to
            verify the accuracy of our financial reporting. To learn more about
            how donations are used, check out our latest Annual Report.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> Can I adopt or bring a sponsored child to Canada?</span>
            No. We do not organize adoption or bringing children to Canada for
            visits. Your help to improve a child’s quality of life and
            self-reliance in their own countries and cultures has deeper value
            than moving them to a foreign country.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>What is my Expected Delivery Timing For Receiving Order?</span>
            We will send your items by mail, within 7 to 10 business days. There
            is no cost charged to you for shipping and handling.
